h1. Pseudorandom numbers generator library

By Pavel fanda Novotn√Ω, Ota Pavelek

C++ object oriented library for generating pseudorandom numbers. It supports
many uniform generators and transforms numbers generated by them to some common
used probability distributions.

h1. Using

# Include _pseudorandom.h_ in Your project
# Create generator object: RandomGenerator<MT32> rg((unsigned long)time(NULL));
# Use: double exp = rg.Exponential(3);

h1. Generators of uniform distributions

* Mersenne Twister
* Cellular automaton based generator

h2. About cellular automaton based generator

Anthony Pasqualoni created very good pseudorandom generator for number in
uniform distribution using 256-state cellular automaton
More information including tests and comparation with other generators (mt19937,
taus etc.) can be found at http://home.southernct.edu/~pasqualonia1/ca/report.html

h2. Uniform generator change

Just pass class as teplate argument while creating RandomGenerator object.
RandomGenerator<MT32> rg((unsigned long)time(NULL));
RandomGenerator<CA>   rg((unsigned long)time(NULL));
