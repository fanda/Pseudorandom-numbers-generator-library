h1. Pseudorandom numbers generator library

By Pavel fanda Novotn√Ω, Ota Pavelek

C++ object oriented library for generating pseudorandom numbers. It supports
many uniform generators and transforms numbers generated by them to some common
used probability distributions.

h1. Using

# Include _pseudorandom.h_ in Your project
# Create generator object: RandomGenerator<MT32> rg((unsigned long)time(NULL));
# Use: double exp = rg.Exponential(3);
